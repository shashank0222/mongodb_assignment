    "MongoDB is a NoSQL database technology that stores its data in JSON format rather than a relational format that you’d find in SQL databases. This makes MongoDB flexible because data can be stored in a hierarchical format within the JSON document, thereby making it easy and fast to retrieve records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL,” which stands for Not Only SQL. The main difference between these is how they store their information. A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures. It does not follow the relational model provided by traditional relational database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB can be preferred over SQL in scenarios where data is unstructured, complex, there is no pre-determined schema and you need to handle large amounts of data and store it as documents. The decision to use MongoDB vs SQL depends on various factors. For simple use and limited system offerings, SQL might be more suitable whereas if your system fulfills the prerequisites and optimized querying is desired, you might rely on a NoSQL Database like MongoDB."
